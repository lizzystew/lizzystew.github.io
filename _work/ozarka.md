## The Challenge

Springbox was tasked with taking six regional water brands, and giving each a locally authentic presence and voice on social. Three of the six brands fell under my umbrella, and this is the story of just one of them — Texas-based Ozarka. 

## The Voice

Everything’s bigger in Texas. That includes the pride that Texans have for their home state, and the hello that they wave to their neighbors. With this in mind, we crafted a social voice for Ozarka that was authentic, friendly, and partial to "y'all's" — and brought that voice to life in both social content and responses. 

## The Results

Through consistent community management, Ozarka’s social channels saw a 3.2% growth in fans.
