## The Challenge

Springbox recently rebranded and launched a new website, complete with new offerings. They needed to get the word out — and grow brand awareness among both current and potential clients. What’s more, as champions of a fully evolved digital ecosystem, they needed a social presence that worked in tandem with the new site to generate interest and leads.

## The Strategy

In order to build a fully flushed out social strategy, we audited Springbox’s social channels and did competitor research to find out what was working in the agency industry. We also did internal interviews and surveys in order to define a consistent social voice and tone. Based on our research we provided channel recommendations, content buckets and examples, and we outlined a voice that was professional, but playful — like Springbox itself. 


To announce the launch, I designed and executed a paid social campaign to grow Springbox’s audience on Twitter and LinkedIn. I also managed the Springbox content calendar and oversaw all social and blog content creation.

## The Results

Engagement rates increased, and we saw follower growth on both Twitter and LinkedIn, as well as a significant increase in traffic to the new website from social.
