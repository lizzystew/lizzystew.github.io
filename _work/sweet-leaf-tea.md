## The Challenge

Though Sweet Leaf Tea started right here in Texas, after joining the Nestlé Waters family in 2011 they were able to sell Granny's homemade goodness all over the country. It wasn't all smooth sailing, though — in December of 2015 Sweet Leaf Tea issued a voluntary recall of their glass bottles, and looked to Springbox to help manage the crisis and get the brand's social channels back on their feet. 

## The Recall, the Campaign, and Community Management

To manage the recall, we prepped response models, set up a war room, and monitored all incoming conversations surrounding the brand. We responded to all comments within a two hour window, and delivered daily reports on sentiment, mentions, and press coverage, escalating threats as necessary. 

After the dust settled, we turned to a local influencer campaign to boost social word of mouth in the brand's hometown of Austin, Texas. I vetted influencers and selected content that aligned with Sweet Leaf's aesthetic and values, and delivered a comprehensive campaign report. 

To deepen connections with both new and existing fans, I made sure Granny's signature warmth and humor shone through in every response I wrote. (She has a particular affini-tea for terrible puns.)

## The Results

Through community management, the brand saw a 36% increase in positive social mentions, and their content saw consistent engagement rates of almost twice the industry benchmark, even after the recall.
