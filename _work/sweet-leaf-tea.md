Chalk uses the default Jekyll syntax highlighting gem Rouge. It has a customized style for both light and dark theme.
Use the `highlight` tag to use the following code highlighting your preferred language:

## Headings

Chalk includes 3 headings by default:

## Heading first level
### Heading second level
#### Heading third level

{% highlight markdown %}
## Heading first level
### Heading second level
#### Heading third level
{% endhighlight %}

## Lists

Unordered list example:
* Unordered list item 1
* Unordered list item 2
* Unordered list item 3
* Unordered list item 4

Ordered list example:
1. Ordered list item 1
2. Ordered list item 1
3. Ordered list item 1
4. Ordered list item 1

## Quotes

A quote looks like this:

> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor
incididunt ut labore et dolore magna.

## Media

Images can be added with a default `<img>` tag.
If you wish that an image can be enlarged on click use the image include tag. You can pass 3 variables:
- `path`: Image to show in the blog post.
- `path-detail`: Image to show when enlarging.
- `alt`: Alt text for image in blog post.

{% include layout_image.html path="documentation/sample-image.jpg" alt="Sample image" %}

Videos can be added and are responsive by default (4x3 by default, 16x9 with extra class).
