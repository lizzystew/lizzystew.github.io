## Content Creation and Community Management

Although Sweet Leaf Tea is now a national brand, in 2016 they were looking for ways to reconnect with their Austin roots. I collaborated with teammates to create hyperlocal content that would drive sales and make Granny proud.

I was also the voice of Granny on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram — and made sure to keep the brand's warmth and humor front and center.

## The Influencer Campaign

In order to grow brand awareness and affinity in Sweet Leaf Tea’s hometown of Austin, TX, we partnered with local Instagram influencers to spread the love. I vetted each influencer, approved content, and prepared the final campaign report.

## The Product Recall

When Sweet Leaf Tea decided to issue a voluntary recall of their glass bottles, my team and I created a thorough supply of response models and monitored online channels for all relevant conversations. We provided daily reports on sentiment, press, and high profile mentions, and responded to all incoming comments in under two hours.

Later on, we selected the most supportive fans that we responded to for a surprise and delight initiative, and sent them Sweet Leaf Tea swag.
