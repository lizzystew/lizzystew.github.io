      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I’m a social media marketer with a sharp editorial eye and a knack for problem-solving. I’m passionate about bringing strategy, storytelling, and analytics together to create social content that’s authentic, engaging, and drives results.</p>

      <p>I'm a military kid who put down roots in Austin, Texas. I majored in English at Southwestern University, where I honed my writing and editing skills working for the school newspaper. Social media excites me because it’s a place where creativity, psychology, and strategy intersect — and it’s constantly evolving. I’m happiest on a collaborative team that pushes me to do my best and keep learning.</p>

      <p>In my spare time you’ll find me reading (Neil Gaiman is a favorite), training for my first 10K, or singing along to the entire Hamilton score.</p>
